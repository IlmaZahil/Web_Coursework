			<div id="intro"><h3>Responsible Travel</h3>
				<p>Tourism is an industry that drives people to travel for recreation and leisure. We love travelling. But we don’t love what tourism can do to our planet. Travelling gives us an opportunity to experience new cultures and witness beautiful places that we have never seen before. But, it comes with a great responsibility.</p>
				<p> Pollution, overconsumption, exploitation, vandalism and emissions are major effects of tourism. Tourism has power to uplift communities from poverty but it also affects the lifestyle and culture of different communities.</p>
				<p> We only have one planet. Therefore, let’s learn to travel responsibly and in an eco-friendly way. No action is ever too small and we all have the power to change the world. So below are ten responsible travel tips to become a responsible tourist.</p>

			<div class="tips2">
			<!-- tip #1, #2, #3, #4 -->
				<h5>#1 Say no to plastic</h5> 
				<p>We tend to buy plastic bags every time and we don’t reuse either. In order to reduce the overall plastic consumption simply say NO to plastic! Where ever possible always avoid buying plastic products and educate the locals about the negative impacts of using them. </p>
				
				<h5>#2 Use reusable bottles</h5> 
				<p>Millions of plastics bottles are being disposed by humans globally every minute. Try to use reusable water bottles throughout your journey. if there are issues with having to drink dirty water simply buy a water filtration bottle which delivers clean and safe drinking water.</p>
				
				<h5>#3 Travel by public transport</h5> 
				<p>This is a great opportunity to meet locals and experience more of the country you are visiting. It also reduces carbon footprint since you are choosing an already existing on ground transport. </p>
				
				<h5>#4 Respect locals and their culture</h5> 
				<p>Treat locals in a respectful way and always remember you are a guest to them. Don’t forget to behave according to their culture and dress code because we view things differently and customs might be different from one country to another. </p>

			<!-- tip #5, #6 -->
				<h5>#5 Learn the local language and be friendly with the local community</h5>
				<p>Learn some key phrases of the local language such as how to say ‘hello’ or ‘how are you’ and ‘thank you’. This increases the bond and don’t forget to be kind and polite always. Google Translate can be used to learn few phrases of different languages.</p>
				
				<h5>#6 Ethical photography </h5>
				<p>Taking photographs is the best way to keep the memories of your trip. Would you be happy if someone takes a photograph of you without your consent? First have a little talk or smile<br> and point your cameras to ask if it is okay to take a photograph.</p>

			<!-- tip #7, #8 #9 #10 -->
				<h5>#7 Walk everywhere and support local businesses</h5>
				<p>Roam the streets by foot to get the most out of your travel journey. Stay in locally-owned guest houses and buy from talented local sellers to support their hard work.</p>
				
				<h5>#8 Become an animal friendly traveler</h5>
				<p>Don’t support animal tourism such as elephant rides, animal performances and swimming with dolphins. If you do so make sure you visit places that truly support ethical tourism. Experience more about animals in their natural habitats rather than going to zoos or wildlife parks.</p>
				
				<h5>#9 Choose eco-friendly accommodation</h5>
				<p>Tourism is moving towards sustainability. Therefore, it is easy to scan through websites and book hotels that support eco-friendly accommodation.</p>
				
				<h5>#10 Respect the environment</h5>
				<p>Today, it’s a common sight to is piles of garbage on hikes or near beaches or in national parks. Keep the trash with you until you can find an adequate recycling bin to throw it. </p>
